# 🎉 Welcome to BioBase! 🌱

Hey there! 👋 This is **BioBase**, a fun little project where I tried to learn **React Native** with **TypeScript** while making learning about the human body more interactive and exciting. 🚀 Let's dive into what this project is all about!

---

## 🧠 What's the Idea?

The goal here was simple: **learn React Native + TypeScript** while creating something that makes exploring the human body systems fun and educational. Instead of boring textbook diagrams, why not make it **interactive and customizable**? 🤔

## ✨ Cool Features

Here’s what makes BioBase awesome:

- 🎥 **Video Integration**: Watch videos (like the Digestive System) directly in the app. Learning by visuals is the best! 📽️
- 🎤 **Text-to-Speech**: Don’t feel like reading? Let the app read out the content for you! Supports Spanish. 🗣️
- 🎨 **Customizable Themes**: Change font size and background colors (White, Black, or Sepia) to make reading easier and more comfortable. 🖌️
- 🗂️ **Multiple Body Systems**: Explore systems like Digestive, Nervous, Respiratory, and more with simple navigation. 🩻
- 📖 **Interactive Content**: Scroll through rich content, with images and descriptions for each body system. 🖼️
- 🎮 **Games & Quizzes**: Play games and take quizzes to test your knowledge. 🧩
